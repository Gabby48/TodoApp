Yesterday project was planned, features, MVP, tech stack, comparing competitors, possible timeline.
Realised JavaScript might be better than Python as it will be alot easier to integrate buttons etc.
The next step after planning will be a bit of research on how to go about things. Ideally want to start coding soon.
