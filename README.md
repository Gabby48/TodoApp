# TodoApp
This repository will store my todo app project. The app will focus on making a todo app catered to people with ADHD.

Overview
This is one of my first personal coding projects, and as someone with ADHD I thought it was fitting to create an app catered to this.

Problem Statement: Need the ability to track tasks in a way that's easy and not overwhelming.

Solution: Todo app for the ADHD mind.

Features
- Quick item capture of to-do items with different methods such as voice, quick submission, etc.
- Ability to break tasks into smaller subtasks, with maybe the possibility of using AI to automate this.
- Clear emphasis on deadlines, including a calendar view to see items that need handling soon, as well as task reminders.
- Ability to prioritize tasks in terms of the most important but also the easiest task to get done, and the task the user is more gravitated to at the moment.
- Customization and Flexibility with the ability to rearrange the view.
- Create a great sense of accomplishment when tasks are completed.
- Brain Dump section to just get thoughts down quickly.

How to Run : 
To-Do app will load into default layout.
1. "+" will be present to add tasks which will open into different options (voice, text etc.)
2. Users will click a task and then have the option to edit, break etc.
3. Tasks will be in categories -  To do, In progress, Almost there and Done. Like Jira people can move it from one category.
4. Brain Dump will allow for just putting thoughts on just click and start typing/talking.
5. Views will be rearrangeable by dragging and dropping and things will snap to a different position.
6. Ability to customize things like colour etc.
